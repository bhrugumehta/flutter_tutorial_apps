// material.dart is required for various widgets like
// Container, Material design i.e. Flutter SDK

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

//main () is the entry point, main() is required by dart
//you can here, omit the void in front of main, default is void
main() {
  //runApp() provided by the material.dart
  //which loads/run the app
  //require widget as parameter
  //Here, Container is the widget
  //So, at least one widget required to make flutter app because everything in
  //flutter is widget !!!
  runApp(Container());
}
